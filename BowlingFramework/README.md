# Bowling Game
============
  
Write a framework to be used by a bowling alley.
  
The framework will provide a public interface to:
* Input how many pins were knocked down, called each time a ball is thrown.
* Retrieve the current score, to be called at any time.
  
Please follow what you consider to be best practices during development.

A game of bowling consists of ten frames.
  
In each frame, the bowler will have two chances to knock down as many pins as possible with their bowling ball (maximum of ten).
